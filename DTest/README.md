# DyalogBuild
This folder contains an updated version of the Dyalog **]dtest** and **]dbuild** user commands, with small tweaks demonstrated in the December 7th Webinar. The fixes will be incorporated in a new release of Dyalog User Commands and posted to [the User Command download page](https://www.dyalog.com/tools/user-commands.htm).

To update your copy of the user commands, copy the file DyalogBuild.dyalog into the folder SALT\spice below your main Dyalog program folder. Depending on how Dyalog APL is installed, this may require administrative rights.
